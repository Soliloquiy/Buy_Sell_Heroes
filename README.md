# Midterm Project - Buy/Sell Listings Website

Tweeter is a front-end featured web application built with Node and Express that allow users to view an aesthetic interface for a database of messages. The user can input a message and instantly see it updated on their screen in a neat textbox with randomized names, handles, and avatars. User functionality includes: Fixed header when scrolling; Responsive layout design for different devices and screen sizes; Error boxes for incorrect inputs, which are displayed in a smooth transition with the ultimate effect of the tweet not being submitted. To put it briefly, Tweeter is a simple and efficient single-page Twitter clone.
